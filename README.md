# rework-time-analysis
A real-world rework time study from my internship. Tasks were broken down into step-by-step actions, categorized into Value-Added (VA), Essential Non-Value Added (ENVA), and Non-Value Added (NVA) time. Results were analyzed using Power BI to uncover inefficiencies and optimize productivity on the manufacturing line.

# 🔧 Rework Time Analysis – Ather Energy (Internship Project)

This project analyzes rework activities in a manufacturing setup using real-time stopwatch observations. Each task is broken down into individual steps and categorized as:

- ✅ **VA**: Value-Added (direct contribution to task)
- 🟠 **ENVA**: Essential Non-Value Added (required but non-productive)
- ❌ **NVA**: Non-Value Added (wasteful time)

The goal is to identify inefficiencies, reduce unproductive time, and improve line productivity using simple tools: Excel and Power BI.
