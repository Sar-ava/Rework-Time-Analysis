# rework-time-analysis
A real-world rework time study from my internship. Tasks were broken down into step-by-step actions, categorized into Value-Added (VA), Essential Non-Value Added (ENVA), and Non-Value Added (NVA) time. Results were analyzed using Power BI to uncover inefficiencies and optimize productivity on the manufacturing line.
